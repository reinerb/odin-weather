# Odin Project: Weather App

## Goal

To explore API calls by building a weather application.

A live version of this page is available [here](https://reinerb.github.io/odin-weather/).

## Future ideas

- Add the ability to view multiple cities at once.
- Add local storage of above cities.
- Better city identification - by lat/long or US ZIP code or similar.
- Default city by browser location.
